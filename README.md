# Component HoopTesting_ReportGenerator

This document provides an overview of the project structure for the HoopTesting_ReportGenerator component.

## Folder Structure

The project is organized into several key directories, each serving a specific purpose. Below is a breakdown of the main folders and their roles:

### Root Directory
- **HoopTesting_ReportGenerator**
    - **renderer**
      - **components**
      - **interfaces**
      - **pages**
      - **utils**

### Detailed Breakdown

#### 1. `components`
This folder contains reusable UI components that are used throughout the application. Each component is typically self-contained and can be imported into various pages or other components.

#### 2. `interfaces`
This folder includes TypeScript interface definitions that are shared across the project. Interfaces help in defining the shape of data and ensure type safety.

Example file: `index.ts`
```typescript
// You can include shared interfaces/types in a separate file
// and then use them in any component by importing them. For
// example, to import the interface below do:
//
// import User from 'path/to/interfaces';
// eslint-disable-next-line @typescript-eslint/no-unused-vars
import { IpcRenderer } from 'electron'
```

#### 3. `pages`
This directory contains the main pages of the application. Each page represents a distinct view or screen within the app.

#### 4. `utils`
Utility functions and helper methods that are used across the application are stored in this folder. These functions are typically stateless and can be reused in different parts of the project.

#### 5. `renderer`
This is the main directory for the renderer process in an Electron application. It includes all the front-end code that runs in the renderer process.

### Additional Files

- **`.next`**: This folder is typically used by Next.js for storing build and runtime files.
- **`next-env.d.ts`**: TypeScript declaration file for Next.js.
- **`tsconfig.json`**: Configuration file for TypeScript.

## Conclusion

The project is well-structured with a clear separation of concerns. Each folder serves a specific purpose, making the codebase organized and maintainable. By following this structure, developers can easily navigate through the project and understand the role of each component, interface, and utility function.
